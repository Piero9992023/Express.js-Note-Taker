  ## Description
  The purpose of this project was to make it easier for the average person to take notes down what whether if it is notes for class or notes for their upcoming events. My note taking application was makes it easier for people to remember something very important in their life since they note something down then save it, their note will always be saved until they decided it is time to delete their previous notes. I built this project because even I have had times where I forget things and wished I would've have had a place to jot down notes where they can be saved and then later on deleted when I no longer needed those notes. I have learnt many things through the experience of building this app. I have learnt how to properly install npm packages and how to correcly deploy my application through heroku. One of the biggest challenged I faced through this experience was that I have accidently changed the starter code that was given to me. When I tested my application when I have changed the starter code my buttons in the website to save, delete, and clear the note were not showing but quickly went back to change the starter code back to the original starter code that was given to me. I learned to never mess with the starter code that I given to me unless there are clear bugs in the code. 
  ## Installation
  Express and uuid are what I have downloaded through npm to make this application work. Have also used the require method with path and fs. I have downloaded these packages by typing "npm i" through the repository's terminal.
